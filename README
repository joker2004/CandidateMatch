This webpage is powered by Angular and Python
Python serves as the backend by retrieving JSON data through the JobAdder API provided
Two kinds of data are retrieved : candidate data and job data which contains open positions and qualifications needed
The python program then matches the candidates and the job by matching the Job Skills and the Candidate Skill Tags
The best candidate who match the job description is then filtered, those candidates that match the most skills for a job are considered the most qualified

>>How to run the program

-Open Terminal
-Under angularpython folder cd src folder
-Run Command ng serve
-Check to see that it says compiled successfully

-Open a second terminal while keeping the first one open
-Under src folder cd the Flask folder
-Run the file rest_server.py  in the flask folder using command python rest.py
-Proceed to browser and open http://localhost:4200/
-shortlisted list of job candidates will be displayed


Improvements to be considered.
Add weighted job skills to Job API data which will help to match candidates with the most preferred skills rather than maximum skillsets that match.
